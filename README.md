A simple project to identify the age group of a person from his/her face. Images are from the UTKFace Dataset, which is an open dataset where there 23k images of persons, with their ages. I transformed this problem into a classification task, with binning ages into 7 groups. So the model tries to predict which age group the person in the image belongs. There are 5 conv. layers, followed by a layer with 10 units activated by a Relu, and this model is 60% accurate in the test set.
